I have been the UX lead for Autodesk CFD since 2011, through the following product releases:

- Autodesk Simulation CFD 2012
- Autodesk Simulation CFD 2013
- Autodesk Simulation CFD 2014
- Autodesk Simulation CFD 2015
- Autodesk CFD 2016

Prior to that I was involved in the design, testing, and release of eight consecutive on-time quarterly releases of CFdesign simulation software, which was acquired by Autodesk and further developed as Simulation CFD.

In this role I am a generalist designer with responsibilities spanning product design & strategy, user research, interaction design, UI design, design planning & facilitation, prototyping, visual design, usability testing, and design evangelism.
